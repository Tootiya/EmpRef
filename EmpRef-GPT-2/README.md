## Data

The data used in this project can be found at `code/_reformat`. 

Details about our source dataset and the automated annotation process are explained in the paper. The source dataset is available at [Motivational-Interviewing-Dataset](https://github.com/anuradha1992/Motivational-Interviewing-Dataset).

The Jupyter notebook `Empref-Prep.ipynb` contains the code we used for automated annotation.

Here are the original codes for the classifiers used for automated annotations:
- Emotion: [GoEmotions by Google Research](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/goemotions)
- Intent: [EmpatheticIntents by Anuradha](https://github.com/anuradha1992/EmpatheticIntents)
- Communication Mechanisms: [Empathy-Mental-Health](https://github.com/behavioral-data/Empathy-Mental-Health)

## Acknowledgements
