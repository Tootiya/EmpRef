<Speaker>: I have been with my boyfriend for more than a year. He recently got a new job and travels a lot. I’m not used to him being gone all the time. I feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesn’t keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day, which he used to.
 I feel lost, sad and unwanted. This is really a tough new challenge. I just want to break up with him, but I love him so much. I don’t know why he is acting this way lately.

It sounds like you and your friend are both in a similar position of being recently single and not ready for another romantic relationship, but still desiring physical intimacy and connection with someone you care about. It's important to prioritize your own feelings and boundaries in this situation, and to communicate openly and honestly with your friend about what you are and are not comfortable with.

It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family. The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister’s house everything changed. That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again.  She apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she didn’t love me anymore and had no feelings for me. The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant. This wasn’t an accident. We were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. I love her so much. I have never been bad to her. I've treated her the best I can. I wanted her to be my wife. I was going to propose to her when she got back. Now I'm losing my family and my mind. I don't know what to do. <Listener>: I am sorry to hear of these troubles.

Conversation Context:
<Speaker>: My husband had an emotional affair with his ex-wife in November. She invited him to dinner, alone, with their daughter. I wasn’t aware of this until after 11pm when I asked where he was. He had been drinking, and I told him not to come home that night. The next morning, we talked about going to counseling. He went out that night with friends and said his ex-wife wasn't going. I found out in April that she did go. I gave him the chance to get everything out in the open. I found out that he stayed that second night with her. I asked if they slept in the same bed, and he said yes, both nights. His daughter wasn't there the second night. He claims they didn't have sex, but what else should I think? <Listener>: I agree with you that professional counseling is a wise choice for your relationship.

Conversation Context:
<Speaker>: My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.
 The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.

It sounds like you are struggling with feelings of inadequacy and shame related to your experience of trauma and PTSD. It can be difficult to see others succeed and feel like you are falling short, especially when it comes to something as challenging as healing from trauma. However, it's important to remember that everyone's healing journey is unique and that there is no "right" way to heal.

Conversation Context:
<Speaker>: About two and a half months ago, I met a woman on a dating site. We went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, I ended up at her house on a the Friday night one week after our first date. We respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. After that, I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. Then one day, she went to her family’s house on Thanksgiving and everything changed. Within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. We had finally found each other. We told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. A few days after Thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. I was very hurt and didn’t understand. Then another week later, she told me she couldn’t do it at all anymore. I was crushed!
   A few days later, she tells me how much she’s missing me and “let’s get together for lunch” or something like that. Then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other (in love, not just sex), but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. So for her child’s sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. She had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. She doesn’t even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. I know she needs time, and all I can do is take care of myself. We have agreed to remain friends, and if this doesn’t work out for her, we will try again.

Base Model Response:
It's completely normal to feel concerned or curious about any unusual symptoms or bodily changes, including a small lump or bump on your neck. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the cause of the lump and receive proper treatment. They can evaluate the lump, take a medical history, and perform any necessary tests to determine if it's anything to be concerned about.

In the meantime, here are some possible causes of a

Base Model Response:
It sounds like you may be experiencing a common phenomenon known as "misophonia," which is characterized by the belief that someone is talking about you or making a comment about you, even when there is no evidence to support this belief. This can be a symptom of social anxiety disorder, and it can be especially distressing when it occurs in social situations.

Anxiety can cause our brains to be more vigilant and attentive to

Fine-tuned Model Response:
<Listener>: So, when we are on high alert, our brains tend to look for threats and often we will jump to conclusions that are not necessarily supported by evidence. <Listener>: This is why I say it is "anxiety" that makes you think you heard something about you. <Listener>: It is not necessarily that there is someone actually making fun of you, it is that your brain is looking for threats and it has jumped to that conclusion. <Spe

<Listener>: (emotion: neutral, intent: agreeing) It's not necessarily unnatural to feel like people are talking about you, and it's not necessarily unnatural for your brain to jump to that. <Listener>: (emotion: neutral, intent: agreeing) The problem is when we jump to that and then we are on high alert, our brains tend to look for threats and we often jump to the worst possible conclusions. <Speaker>:

EmpRef Model Response:
<Listener>: (emotion: neutral, intent: neutral/suggesting, er: 0, in: 0, ex: 0) In the case of anxiety, our brains tend to jump to the worst possible scenario. <Listener>: (emotion: neutral, intent: agreeing) So, yes, it is possible that you heard something about you, but more likely, you were worried that someone else had said something about you. <Speaker

<Speaker>: My girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years. We recently just broke up again last night on New Year’s Eve. When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened. She acts like everything is alright. This has been going on for two years. I do love her and care about her and her children a lot, but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man. She is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man. It makes me feel like crap because I cannot give her everything that she wants. She told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her. Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already? I am in my 30s and she is in her 40s. <Listener>: Love is not enough to keep a relationship together. <Listener>: The people need to get along happily too.
